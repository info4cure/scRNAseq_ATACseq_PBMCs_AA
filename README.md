The GitHub repository for the article "Integrated single-cell chromatin and transcriptomic analyses of human peripheral immune cells in patients with alopecia areata" contains all the necessary files to replicate the analyses and results presented in the study. The repository includes raw data files from the scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq experiments, organized by sample and condition. It also provides R and Python scripts for data preprocessing, normalization, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and visualization. Each script is annotated to guide users through the specific steps of the analysis, ensuring that the methodology is transparent and reproducible.
